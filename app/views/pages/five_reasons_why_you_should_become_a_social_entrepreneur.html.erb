<p>Social entrepreneurship is a field that is growing and attracts more and more ambitious entrepreneurs for its specificities - the possibility to create a profitable business or a successful organization and to shape a better society simultaneously. It is probably the best way to create a business currently and that explains the fantastic growth that it is experiencing. But why should you become a social entrepreneur? Is there more to it than a combination of go-to-market approach and sustainability? Here are five inspiring reasons.
<br><br>
Wondering what social entrepreneurship is? Check out our article about it <a href="http://www.sustainize.com/pages/what_is_social_entrepreneurship">here</a>! 
<br><br>
<strong>1. We all have a role to play</strong>
<br><br>
The world as we know it is facing many critical challenges. For example, while an extreme minority of people are enriching themselves, about 80% of the world’s population lives in poverty. That’s just one of the many issues that we are facing. 
So to put it frankly, the world needs you. 
The good news is that whatever you are good at, you can play a role. If you are a marketer, finance-guru, tech-nerd, lawyer, designer, engineer, recruiter or sales specialist does not matter. There are so many social problems to be solved that you will always be able to contribute.
<br><br>
<strong>2. Probably the best way to create a long-lasting venture</strong>
<br><br>
You will have the possibility to create a successful long-lasting business or organization. As the rules of the market are progressively changing, businesses have to become more aware of social issues. The problem is that most traditional businesses’ social impact is more negative than positive. Even though many of them attempt to offset this through CSR campaigns, the market is slowly turning its back on them and opening new opportunities for a better type of business. Consumers are being increasingly aware of and interested in sustainable products, which makes this market grow at a rapid pace. Traditional businesses, in an effort to become more socially responsible, are hoping to partner with sustainability pioneers. Also, governments have put the sustainability issue at the top of their agenda, they are ready to lend a helping hand to anyone making a positive impact on society. 
You will get more support and help because you are not just pursuing profit. A lot of people are willing to contribute to good causes, not for the ROI (Return On Investment), but for the pleasure to make the world a better place.
<br><br>
<strong>3. Make your life more meaningful</strong>
<br><br>
Being a social entrepreneur is more than funding a business. It’s about creating a solution to an existing problem that you care about, by doing that you are giving meaning to your life and to the life of others. It’s about authenticity and purpose. Through your brand, services and products you have the possibility to touch the world in a different way, one that is truly meaningful. A social entrepreneur also has the capacity to inspire other people by creating a positive environment for others to find their true purpose as well. Not only through your work but also through all of your interactions professional and private. You can become a source of inspiration.
<br><br>
<strong>4. Be in a class of your own</strong>
<br><br>
All we can hear these days is the word entrepreneur. There is a huge number of them and as one it can be hard to be seen. Social entrepreneurs are fewer, they contribute to a better society and that definitely sets them apart from the flock. If you decide to become a social entrepreneur, you will benefit from a special status, which will undoubtedly be a branding advantage.
<br><br>
<strong>5. Keep developing and always feel motivated</strong>
<br><br>
Two common aspects when it comes to how happy you are with your work is that you need to feel that what you do is meaningful and that you are developing. In traditional jobs many feel that what they are doing as no purpose, even if they have succeeded in terms of profit or expansion. A social entrepreneur, however, always has a purpose and can develop as an individual as well as a professional thanks to the many challenges encountered. There is always a new aspect to tackle or a better way to operate, that’s one of the missions of social entrepreneurs: never stop improving. 
From this motivation and purpose flows happiness. If there’s one thing I would remember from the successful social entrepreneurs out there is that they do what they do because it brings them joy despite the setbacks and difficulties encountered. Almost all social entrepreneurs are stressing the fact that they are loving what they do, that’s what keeps them going.
<br><br>
Most of us want to make a positive impact in the world and find a purpose. Are we going to stand by and wait instead of taking the lead and creating the world that we wish to see?
